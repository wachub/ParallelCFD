This program compares the performance gains provided by a few parallel algorithms compared with their sequential ones.

> make 

to run the program.

This runs both the sequential and the parallel versions of the same program and compares the time advantage gained. 

Note that the time gain may not be strictly proportional to the number of processes since there is an extra overhead involved in creating
processes.
