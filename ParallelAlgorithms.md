Hence any parallel algorithm that is capable of supporting parallelism needs to have 3 components.

> Hardware support in the form of GPU's,multi-core CPUs etc.

> Software support for the hardware OPENMPI, OPENMP, CUDA etc.

> The actual parallel algorithm that is implemented.


Parallel algorithms are basically the algorithms that can be executed one piece at a time in different processing devices and the results combined together at the end to get the whole result. Algorithms vary to the degree to which they can be parallelized ranging from
